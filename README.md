# BeeHuman :honeybee:

A Software engineering course project. Represents a prototype for a donations and volunteering platform created in stages according to the Agile methods. 
The general idea was to create a platform with two separate modules - one for volunteering and one for donations, where users would 
post their requests or make offers on various items and services. Successful volunteering stories would make their way to the blog section :)

The project was created using Angular framework and Express.js with a connection to a Firebase Realtime Database.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
